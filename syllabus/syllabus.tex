\leftline{\bf  Homework}

There will be three homeworks, designed as term projects. All three will be similar
from the technical point of view: they will involve reading a number of vectors with several 
million elements from provided files (using Python and Jupyter notebooks), simple operations 
with these vectors such as binning and low-order statistics, and visualization of your results. 

The problems and links to data files will be posted at the class website about two weeks 
before the homework is due. They will address these three general themes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stellar number density distribution in MW
\item Determination of luminosity function 
\item Stellar metallicity distribution in MW  
\end{enumerate}

We will use modern software engineering tools, such as github for version control and Jupyter 
notebooks, for HW submission.

These papers are very relevant for our class and cover subjects that are
not going to be discussed in detail. Choose a paper and prepare a 10 min long 
Powerpoint (or equivalent) presentation
(presumably including the most important figures from the paper). Pretend 
you did the work yourself and are giving an invited talk at a meeting. 
There will be a 5 min long question and answer session after the talk. 
The purpose of this exercise is to 1) learn some science, 2) practice 
extracting relevant information from papers 3) practice giving talks,
4) practice having over-active audience.

Do not forget the following good practices: 1) empty your pockets (no loose 
change, keys, phone, and such),
2) talk slowly and sufficently loud, 3) don't look at the floor, control
your audience with direct eye contact, don't turn your back to the audience, 
don't be agressive with the pointer, etc. 4) don't rush (don't overload 
your 10 min long presentation), concentrate on the most important points,
5) emphasize what are truly new, and, possibly, unexpected results.
6) comment on the limitations and pitfalls of the presented analysis;
how do we know it's right, could it be wrong?
